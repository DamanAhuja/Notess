---

### 🔹 1.2 Definition of Data Privacy

**Data Privacy** is the concept that **individuals have the right to control how their personal data is collected, used, processed, stored, and shared** by organizations or governments.

In simple words:

> *Data privacy ensures that personal information is used fairly, lawfully, and transparently, without misuse.*

---

### 🔹 1.3 Scope of Data Privacy

Data privacy governs:

1. **Collection** – what data is collected
2. **Purpose** – why data is collected
3. **Consent** – user permission
4. **Processing** – how data is used
5. **Storage** – where & how long data is stored
6. **Sharing** – with whom data is shared
7. **Deletion** – when data is erased

---

### 🔹 1.4 Core Principles of Data Privacy

These principles form the backbone of modern privacy laws:

1. **Consent**

   * Data must be collected only after user permission
   * Consent must be free, informed, specific, and clear

2. **Transparency**

   * Users must be informed about:

     * What data is collected
     * Why it is collected
     * Who will use it

3. **Purpose Limitation**

   * Data should be used **only for the purpose it was collected**
   * No unauthorized secondary usage

4. **Data Minimization**

   * Collect only the minimum required data
   * Avoid excessive permissions

5. **Security**
